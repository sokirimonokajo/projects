## Hospital Database System 

### Database Systems (CSCI 366)

#### My group and I wrote Java methods on the Netbeans program to read, insert, update and delete data using SQL statements off of a data server program in pgAdmin.

#### The code will work if you have the latest Netbeans and pgAdmin program. It will help if you have a jDBC connection program to see how the java methods implement by using the SQL statements.
